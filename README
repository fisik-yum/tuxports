tuxports: A conversion of older tuxracer and planetpenguin racer course
for extreme tux racer.

All of these courses are licensed under GPL, version 2. I've gone to my 
furthest to verify this.

There is plenty of jank that I still have to clear up.
The course "doing" from planet penguinracer-extras has some textures that
dont render properly.
Other "jank" may include improper placement of trees, bad scaling 
and improper start points.
I could not test all tracks to see of they are faithful to the originals.
I would really appreciate if anyonw could test the planet penguin racer
tracks and let me know. I've left a link to the windows version of the game.
It should run fine on wine too.

All courses are licensed under the GPL version two. If you by any chance are the author of any of these tracks and want it removed please contact me.

Special Thanks to Karsten Eiser for giving me permission to redistribute their track (GPL3), even if it was twenty years old.
