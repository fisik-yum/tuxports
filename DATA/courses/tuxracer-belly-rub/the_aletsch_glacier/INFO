On August 20 2021 I sent an e-mail to the author of this course, in hopes that I could  recieve permission redistribute their course. It went as follows:

"
Hello there! Apologies if I am disturbing you.
I've been working on converting tux racer tracks for a while. I came across an archive of your work/track "Aletsch Glacier" during my search. I was unable to find any information about its licensing. I am writing to ask if you could provide a license (Preferably GPL) for your course. I have added links to my work on github and have attached your course. If you don't feel like it please let me know.

Thank you for your time,

Five days later on the 25th I recieved a reply.

I am really thankful for the reply. It means a lot to me.
