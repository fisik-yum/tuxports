This is the course "The Aletsch glacier" for Tuxracer.

The Aletsch glacier in the Alps is Europe's biggest glacier. A glacier is a 
dangerous area, so be prepaired and have the right equipment for climbing
when you walk on it.
Otherwise you could fall into a crevasse and become an "oetzi".
(Oetzi: Prehistoric human being who was found in the Oetztal-glacier)



INSTALL:
Just copy the subdirectory into the contrib-directory of your Tuxracer-dir.
