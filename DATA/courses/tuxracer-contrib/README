main-contrib:
these were courses that were included originally in tuxracer 0.61.
However these courses never made it into ETR.
Jool's Big Mountain was particularly hard to "debug", because its trees.png file was not of the same dimensions as elev.png and terrain.png
This caused frantic object placement. The trees.png file also has a finish pole at the wrong point, so editing items.lst fixed it.
