oldtux:
this is a repository of older tux racer courses that I have archived.
I've converted their data to to that readable by Extreme Tux Racer. These reside in groups/.
I've also added appropriate changes to groups.lst and events.lst to accomodate the 4 PPR events.
All of these tracks have been tested, but there may be visual glitches at times.
Please do not ever delete items.lst from any of the tracks- these may contain some fixes to object placement.
I have a few other tracs but I am unsure of their licensing, so I will not be including them here.

Currently included track groups:
planetpenguinracer (all tracks that aren't already added)
tuxracer-belly-rub (from archived track repo)
tuxracer-contrib (unported tracks from original game)

Folders:
conversiontools- hacked together bash scripts I use to make life bit easier, and an incomplete course.tcl to course.dim converter
cups-data- data for reconstructing other cups.
